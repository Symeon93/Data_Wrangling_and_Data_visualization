# Data_Wrangling_and_Data_visualization

In this project we use ordinary csv files which we download over HTTP from a file location on the internet.
Upon import, we manipulate, visualize and use in the end a choropleth map (heatmap) to identify the regions 
of highest criminality in San Fransisco based on the official crime reports from 2018.
